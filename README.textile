h2. Usage

h3. First Clone the Repository

<pre>
git clone git@github.com:vlandham/bubble_cloud.git
cd vis
</pre>

h3. You might consider creating a new branch for your Vis

<pre>
git checkout -b interesting_new_bar_chart
</pre>

h3. View built in example

You can start up a local webserver by using python's simple server:

<pre>
python -m SimpleHTTTPServer -p 3000
</pre>

or @thin@ in ruby

<pre>
thin start
# might have to run 'bundle install' first
</pre>

Now go to "http://0.0.0.0:3000":http://0.0.0.0:3000/

and you have a basic visualization

h3. Start Coding

Open up @coffee/vis.coffee@ and start modifying the built in visualization to fit your needs.
