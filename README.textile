For more info, check out the tutorial on "vallandingham.me":http://vallandingham.me/

h2. Usage

h3. First Clone the Repository

<pre>
git clone git@github.com:vlandham/bubble_cloud.git
cd vis
</pre>

h3. Remove Google Analytics Code

To make things easy on myself, This is the same code that is used to
power the live demo. As a consequence, my GA code is in there.

If you could be a nice person and remove or change that in your version,
I'd appreciate it.

Should be a script block around line @70@.

h3. View Demo

You can start up a local webserver by using python's simple server:

<pre>
python -m SimpleHTTTPServer -p 3000
</pre>

or @thin@ in ruby

<pre>
thin start
# might have to run 'bundle install' first
</pre>

Now go to "http://0.0.0.0:3000":http://0.0.0.0:3000/

and you have a basic visualization

h3. Start Coding

Open up @coffee/vis.coffee@ and start modifying the built in visualization to fit your needs.

h2. Folder Organization

* @/@
** main vis area
* @/index.html@
** main page for your visualization. Loads coffeescript and javascript files.
* @/coffee/@
** coffeescript files. @vis.coffee@.
* @/data/@
** data dump for @.csv@ and @.json@ files and other data files your vis uses.
* @/js/@
** javascript goes here. JS Libraries in @libs@ directory
* @/css/@
** put your stylesheets in here

h2. Requirements

To startup the server, you either need @python@, or a bunch of @ruby@ gems (should be simplified in the future).

Run @bundle install@ to get the gems needed. Gems listed in the Gemfile
